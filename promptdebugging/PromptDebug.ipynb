      "| 4 | **Add salt & cardamom**: Stir in the salt and cardamom powder. | Cardamom is optional but gives a classic Mysore Pak flavor. |\n",

      "| 6 | **Transfer to a flat surface**: Remove the pan from heat and pour the dough onto a greased plate or a sheet of parchment paper. | Use a spoon or spatula to spread it evenly. |\n",
      "| 7 | **Cool & cut**: Let it cool for 5–10 minutes, then cut into squares or diamonds. | The sweet will firm up as it cools. |\n",
